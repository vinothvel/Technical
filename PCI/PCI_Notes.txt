1) The registers in the configuration space shall be used to see the memory requirement and IO resource requirement for a device.
2) PCI and PCI-X speed is limited and along with the high count was the reason to move away from parallel to serial bus model.
3) As PCI is progressing towards higher frequency for higher speeds, number of devices were reduced and distance between devices 
also shortened. This was due to reflected wave signalling.

Eventhough 32 device may be connected to bus, practically 10-12 devices can only be connected in a bus due to reflected wave 
signalling.

Reflected Wave signalling.
	To Reduce the the power and cost, the PCI has used low power transmitter which transmits half the power which is required for PCI bus.
  When the wave reaches the termination due to infinite impedance the signal was reflected back. Due to additive nature of the signal 
  the signal power level reached desired power level for the receiver.
  Normally this signal propagation delay should happen with in one clock cycle. This logic limits increase the signal progation 
  delay when more load is connected to bus or when length is more.

  To connect more loads in a bus PCI to PCI bridge to be used. When bridge is used then that bus is isolated from other buses 
  hence each bus can hold 10-12 devices. Each bridge creates new isolated bus. Like this pci architecture allows 256 buses and 32 
  devices in each bus.

For communication with PCI device, PCI architecture has the following options,
1) Programmed IO - When SW wants to communicate with PCI device it indicates the CPU to take data from memory into register and
register to PCI device and vice versa. So this method uses 2 CPU cycle for single transaction and when the data becomes larger 
it occpies more CPU time for this transaction alone. Currently this method is used only when SW wants to comuunicate with PCI 
device ie for small data transfer.

2) DMA - This is most popular for data transaction. Because there is one dedicated DMA engine to handle all memory transactions.
CPU only has to configure the Memory address.

3) Peer to peer - This is communication between two PCI device. This is not prefered since this method requires both device 
should follow same format for data understanding.
