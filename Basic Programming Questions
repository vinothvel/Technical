1) Find size of variable in generic form
  #define sizeof( var) ((&var + 1) - (&var))
  
2) Inline Function vs Macro
  Macro is expanded in the preprocessor time. It is just text substituion and also macros are not type checked where as inline function does.
  Inline function replaces the function call with actual body of the function. Inline is just a request to a compiler.
  Advantage of inline function is, it does not require function call and does not return anything from the function.
  Disadvantage of inline function is, it increases file size as same function code is copied again and again in the program wherever it is called.

what is device tree and can we convert dtb into dts.

How do you debug if stack memory corruption happens. depth in debugging other than debugger and print. Mostly on how stack is corrupted.
Start address of the stack pointer and how much allocated stack size for the given function.
Before main what things are done in microcontroller?
stack pointer assignment in microntroller booting?
boot process in depth of an microcontroller and linux.`

When to choose external osc? and why?
Very often microcontrollers internal oscilators are designed with resistor - capcitor circuit. Resistance and capacitance is prone to 
temperature, hence we may face drift in frequency when ambient changes. To avoid these kind of problems we may go for external OSC.
Crystal oscillators are more accurate and often preferred as external OSC.

PLLs are used in microcontroller for frequency multiplication. PLL takes input from one of the OSC and produces the multiplied frequency
to operate at higher speed more than OSC frequency.

what about QSPI?

I2C - Inter Integrated Circuit / Two Wire Interface(TWI)

1) What is the use of pull up resistor in I2C and without  it can we use?
    I2C operates on open drain configuration, where the line / bus can be pulled down or released
(when released pull up resistor ensures the bus/line voltage is upto the vcc).
If I2C is push pull type of output, master can drive the bus to high when slave tries to drive 
the bus to low which leads to communication issue casuing short (vcc to ground).

    Sinking current means when the current is flowing from load to port. Sourcing current means when the current flows from port to load.
So I2C open drain port is sinking current mode.

2) I2C Arbitration?
    Since I2C is an multi master device, bus contention can happen. This bus contention is avoided using this open drain configuration.
i.e Master continously sense the bus and compares the bus data with master output data. when it mismatch master will halt the transmission.
In this configuration which master pulls line/transmit low first, will get the control of the bus.

3) Clock Stretching or Clock Synchronization?
    In I2C master will generate the clock signal. But sometimes slave may need time to process the data received from master. 
So, to make further delay i2c may pull the clock line to low on the 9th clock cycle (in ACK cycle). There is no timeout mentioned for how much
time slave can hold the clock line low. In the mean time master shall sense the clock line and wait for it to become high again.

    Clock stretching can happen when slave needs to process the data/store the data or to prepare response for the received data.

4) Advantage and Disadvantage of I2C?
    Advantage:
    -> Two wire interface.
    -> Independent addressable slave devices.
    -> Capability to handle multiple master by arbitration.
    -> ACK/NACK for transmission error handling.
    
    Disadvantage:
    -> Due to open drain topology uses more current.
    -> suitable only for short distance
    -> number of slaves are limited by the capcitance of I2C bus
    -> Half Duplex

5) Max Speed and Max number of slaves?
    I2C supports 3 speeds. 100KHz, 400KHz and 1MHz and 3.4MHz.
    For each speed standard capcitances are defined. This capacitance will change the rising and falling time of the bus. 
    Hence to meet the protocol rise and fall time standard, capcitance are defined for each speed.
    For 7bit addressing, I2C supports 128 slaves therotically. But it is limited to less numbers by capcitance on the bus.

SPI - Serial Peripheral Interface

1) SPI configuration?
    SPI uses push pull configuration, hence there is no need for pull up resistors in SPI.
    
2) Why CS is active low?
    In TTL logic, when input is high, the current will flow into the IC. Normally this is very low current.
    when input is low, the current will flow from IC. Normally this is high current.
    Due to this current consuming factor, CS line is kept as active low. So when CS is active, only the active CS consumes more current.
    
3) Max Speed and Max number of slaves?
    SPI protocol does not define any top of communication speed. It can be implemented for 10 / 60Mbps for shorter range.
    If slaves are connected directly, then max number of slaves are limited to the CS pins available on the master chip.
    If it is connected by daisy chain we can go for n number of slaves but with increased time delay in transmission.

4) Advantage and Disadvantage of I2C?
    Advantage:
    -> Full Duplex
    -> No Start / Stop Bit, simpler protocol
    -> Speed is twice as fast as I2C
    -> ACK/NACK for transmission error handling.
    
    Disadvantage:
    -> Single Master
    -> No ACK for error handling
    -> Uses four wire, hence wiring becomes complex as slave count is increases.
    -> Half Duplex
