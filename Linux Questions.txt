What is UBOOT?
  Uboot is first and second stage bootloader. U-Boot performs both first-stage
(e.g., Initial CPU configurations, configuring memory controllers and RAM configurations and loads the uboot into DDR memory) and 
second-stage booting (Loading of kernel). 
e.g U-Boot runs a command-line interface on a console or a serial port. Using the CLI, users can load and boot a kernel, possibly changing parameters from the default.       U-Boot requires its boot commands to explicitly specify the physical memory addresses as destinations for copying data (kernel, ramdisk, device tree, etc.) and for jumping to the kernel and as arguments for the kernel. 
    It manages several internal and external devices such as NAND and NOR Flash memories, Ethernet and USB.
    It supports FTP (IP Stack), FAT, UBIFS(File system).

What is devicetree?
  Device tree is a data structure for describing hardware layout. Using Device tree, a vendor might be able to use an unmodified mainline U-Boot on otherwise special purpose hardware
