What is UBOOT?
  Uboot is first and second stage bootloader. U-Boot performs both first-stage (e.g., configuring memory controllers and SDRAM) and second-stage 
booting (Loading os OS). U-Boot runs a command-line interface on a console or a serial port. Using the CLI, users can load and boot a kernel, possibly
changing parameters from the default. U-Boot requires its boot commands to explicitly specify the physical memory addresses as destinations for copying
data (kernel, ramdisk, device tree, etc.) and for jumping to the kernel and as arguments for the kernel.
