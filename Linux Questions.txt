What is UBOOT?
  Uboot is first and second stage bootloader. U-Boot performs both first-stage
(e.g., Initial CPU configurations, configuring memory controllers and RAM configurations and loads the uboot into DDR memory) and 
second-stage booting (Loading of kernel). 
e.g U-Boot runs a command-line interface on a console or a serial port. Using the CLI, users can load and boot a kernel, possibly changing parameters from the default.       U-Boot requires its boot commands to explicitly specify the physical memory addresses as destinations for copying data (kernel, ramdisk, device tree, etc.) and for jumping to the kernel and as arguments for the kernel. 
    It manages several internal and external devices such as NAND and NOR Flash memories, Ethernet and USB.
    It supports FTP (IP Stack), FAT, UBIFS(File system).

What is devicetree?
  A device tree is simply a tree structure of nodes and properties. Properties are key-value pairs and may contain bothproperties and child nodes
  Device tree is a data structure for describing hardware layout. During the Linux boot process, a "Device Tree Blob" (DTB) file is loaded into memory by U-Boot / UEFI, and a pointer to it is passed to the kernel. This DTB file describes the system's hardware layout to the Linux kernel, allowing for platform-specific code to be moved out of the kernel sources and replaced with generic code that can parse the DTB and configure the system as required.Device Tree Source (DTS) files are simple text files that can be compiled into a binary Device Tree Blob (DTB) format using the Device Tree Compiler (DTC) tool.
  Decompiling a DTB using DTC is lossless, i.e. one can decompile a DTB into a DTS and then compile that DTS back into a DTB without losing any information.
  eg : memory mapping and interrupt pin controls.


what is initial ramdisk?
initrd (initial ramdisk) is a scheme for loading a temporary root file system into memory, which may be used as part of the Linux startup process. initrd and initramfs refer to two different methods of achieving this. Both are commonly used to make preparations before the real root file system can be mounted.
